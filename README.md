# Light-Intensity-Monitoring-System
A project to measure and display light intensity using a TSL2561 luminosity sensor, Arduino Nano, and Mistura PI-4000 process indicator. This system reads light levels, processes the data, and outputs a corresponding analog signal to a display for real-time monitoring.
